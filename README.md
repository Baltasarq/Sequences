# Sequences

Some [mathematical sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence) that caught my attention, implemented in Python.

Each file is a different sequence. The DocString in each sequence function contains links to the OEIS database and/or wikipedia.

There are normally two versions for each sequence: the recursive version, with the postfix: "_seq", and the iterative version, with the postfix: "_seq_it". The reason behind this is that the recursive version is normally easier to understand, while the recursive version is much less performant.
